csvparser
=========

It's a single method csv parser in C#.  
If you just need a quick block of code that's been battle tested and works, this is for you.
Simple, and works with every excel exported csv file I've attempted.

Written because I was looking around at many csv parsers and they were complete overkill.  I mean they work and they're faster, and they csv as a format is a deceptively hideous beast and I'm sure they have full coverage of the format.  But it still rubs me the wrong way to have to carry around a .dll for something as simple as csv parsing.

My goal for this project is to keep things to a single method that just works and works quickly for 95% of the csv formats out there.  If you need something more heavy weight, there are faster, heavier weight, and most importantly better solutions for you elsewhere.
